I thought that chapter 7 really pin pointed a couple important areas of being a software engineer and just a programmer in general.
The first of which being, how to begin starting a project? I cannot count the number of times myself I have received an assignment 
and felt like I had no starting point and had no idea where to begin. The chapter talks about how important it can be to just dive 
in and start with something simple. From there you’ll realize that you really needed to do this first or from there you can move on 
to the next step. This chapter also discussed how important it can be to plan out how you are going to start a project. This is not 
only important for yourself, but it helps everyone working on the project. This means other programmers and the business in need of 
the product. Use cases are very valuable ways to structure this planning. It also people to be specific enough to get the point across, 
but isn’t too specific where it limits a programmer’s ability to write the code sufficiently. One component this chapter helped address
very widely was not to stress and overthink the problems. Often, its almost too easy to just overthink a problem and end up spending twice
as much time trying to solve a problem that couldn’t be solved that particular way. Its important to take a step back and think the 
problem through. This can help solve a lot of unnecessary headaches. I think that’s a very crucial skill to acquire as it not only
helps the group from becoming frustrated, but myself as well.
