Software engineering for a long time has meant a bunch of people who sit in front of a computer and are constantly crunch out code
for different projects. However, the more classes I've had in computer science the more I'm beginning to think that there is a lot
more to the process. There are copious amounts of teamwork involved due to multiple people working on projects. I imagine there is
a deeper level of knowledge that is required about the machines and ui that one uses to complete the task. I think this class is
going to demonstrate to me that I probably did not have to correct impression of what software engineers do, but I am ready to see
what it really means.
