I believe that 12 factor is a really nice standard guide to how things should be done in the programing process. I found that one of 
the most important factors that was brought up was to make sure that ones code is completely disposable. It is important becasue it makes
things easier on new people coming in to understand what is happening and what needs to be done. Disposablility also allows for code to be 
easily changed and amnipulated to fit different types of integrations. I also thought that staging developent was very important. It is 
critical that everyone understands their priorities. We want to ensure that only the people that need access to certain information have
access to it. In general, I thought that most of the components were important to discuss as they are vital to start a piece of software
and to maintain that piece of software as it gets older.
