I think that the first chapter of the book raises a lot of important ideas that computer programmers do not typically think about.
One of the most important points I think the chapter touches on is to work on developing your portfolio as well as taking credit for
the code you produce. Feeling good about what you have done and what you can do helps build confidence and allows for an idividual 
programmer to feel good about what they write. Code can only be so perfect and spending too much time worrying about little nuances 
you can get clouded from the bigger project at hand. I also like the emphasis at the end of the chapter about communication. At the end 
of the day all the code is going to be pointless if there is a lack of communication. Knowing how to correctly communicate with co-workers
is critical to create a successful program.
