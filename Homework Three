The reason that I am taking this class is because it is a required class in my major. I am also taking this course in order to get a feel
for what software engineering looks like in the real world. I want to know whether or not this type of job suites me or not. I also hope
to get an internship sometime and being able to have a little experience beforehand on how things work and the process behind everything
would become very useful. In general, I hope to gain some knowledge that I will ultimately find useful in my life sometime in the future.
